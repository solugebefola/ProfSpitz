## Prof Spitz educational site
### Summary
The site is intended to act as an enrichment for elementary, middle school and high school students.  The vehicle for the enrichment is a series of lessons that make use of rap lyrics to explore topics such as:
- literary devices
- grammatical parts of speech
- critical thinking
- rhetoric

There will be several classes of users for the site.  Students, Teachers, Administrators.

The site will contain lessons, all modeled on a single template.  Each lesson will have a video or text segment provided to the student explaining and giving examples for the lesson objectives, followed by a field for the student to input lyrics and possibly record lyrics(?).

### Users
#### Students
Students will have the ability to sign up for the site through an email invite from a teacher (presumably their classroom teacher).  They will be able to log on to the site after setting a username and password (authorization through BCrypt).  They will have an associated school/institution as well as at least one associated teacher (more may be necessary if multiple types of classes in the school are using the site, i.e. a social studies class uses it for students in a particular grade as well as an english class).

Upon login, a student will be presented with a list of lessons, both completed and uncompleted, perhaps organized by class.  Uncompleted lessons will contain any new lessons made available since last login.  Students will be able to click into and edit their contributions to any lessons that have not been locked by the teacher.
